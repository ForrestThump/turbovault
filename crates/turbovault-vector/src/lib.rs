//! Dense-vector semantic search for TurboVault.
//!
//! Provides HNSW-based nearest-neighbour retrieval using local ONNX embeddings
//! (fastembed) and usearch, with SQLite-backed incremental index management.
//!
//! This crate is only compiled when the `vector-search` feature is enabled on
//! the top-level `turbovault` binary.  All heavy dependencies (fastembed, usearch,
//! rusqlite) are behind the `local` feature which is on by default.
